# FermentationTracker

When COVID-19 forced everyone into lockdown, I began to search for new hobbies that would keep me indoors. I eventually fell into the world of fermentation and created this tool to assist me in keeping track of each project I have in the works.

If you're completely unfamilar with fermentation, the most basic form involves adding salt what you want to ferment, removing air from the environment around the ferment, and then waiting for a period of time. If you wish to learn more, I highly recommend reading "The Noma Guide to Fermentation". 

## Installation

In the root directory:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

The server will start on port 5000.

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view in browser.

The project will load with two active projects and one archived project in the db as examples.
